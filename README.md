# COMAKE Refactored

## [Comake-Remake](https://bw-comake-4-frontend.phillybenh.now.sh)

In an effort to get my portfolio in order and keep the project updated, I'm refactoring this project to better match the original wireframe, improve readability and test coverage, and generally better align with my current preferences.

### Focus

- App Styling
  - Switch to Sass
  - Improve match with wireframe
- Readability and code style
- Test Coverage
